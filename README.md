# EfficientNet-B0-with-bi-GRU-on-medical-image
introduce a new scaling neural network model that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance

#Package dependency
scikit-lean==0.21.2
pytorch==1.0.1
torchvision==0.2.1
pillow==5.4.1
efficientnet-pytorch==0.7.0
In my practice, this implementation needs to be above pytorch 1.0 to work. If there is an incompatibility problem, please feel free to open a problem.
